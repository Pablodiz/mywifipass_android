# MyWifiPass Android

Android application for automated EAP-TLS network configuration and Wi-Fi pass management.

## Overview

MyWifiPass Android is the mobile client component that simplifies the complex process of configuring EAP-TLS networks on Android devices. It provides two main functionalities: end-user Wi-Fi pass management and validator identity verification.

## Features

### For End Users
- **QR Code Scanning**: Instant Wi-fi Pass downloading via QR codes generated by the MyWifiPass System
- **Wi-Fi Pass Management**: Download, store, and manage multiple network configurations
- **Automatic Configuration**: Seamless installation of client certificates and network settings
- **Certificate Installation**: Automated setup of EAP-TLS certificates and CA validation
- **Network Profiles**: Save and organize multiple secure network configurations

### For Validators
- **Identity Verification**: Communicate with the API to verify user identities
- **Authorization Control**: Ensure only authorized personnel can complete network configurations
- **Validation Interface**: Streamlined process for verifying Wi-Fi pass holders
- **Security Enforcement**: Prevent unauthorized network access through identity validation

## How It Works

1. **Wi-Fi Pass Download**: Users scan QR codes or receive Wi-Fi passes through the system
2. **Identity Validation**: Validators verify user identities before granting network access
3. **Automatic Setup**: The app automatically configures network settings and installs certificates
4. **Secure Connection**: Users connect to EAP-TLS networks with zero manual configuration

## Configuration

The app communicates with the MyWifiPass System API to:
- Download Wi-Fi passes and certificates
- Verify user identities and authorization

## Wi-Fi Pass Structure

Wi-Fi passes contain:
- Network SSID and security settings
- Metadata for network context
- URLs for certificate download (client and CA certificates)
- Validation endpoints for identity verification

## Requirements

- Tried on Android 14.0
- Internet connectivity for initial setup and for later validation
- Camera permission for QR code scanning
