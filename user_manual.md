# USER MANUAL

When you open the app, two options will appear: USER and VALIDATOR.

## USER 

This role is used to automatically configure EAP-TLS connections on your device. When you are registered in a MyWifiPass System instance, you will receive an email. Then, you will need to press the (+) button in this app and use the QR Code/URL you received to download a "Wi-Fi Pass".

When you arrive at the location where this Wi-Fi network is available, a "VALIDATOR" will require you to show them your pass. To do this, select the pass from the list, and a QR Code will be displayed. The validator will scan it, and after they check your documentation, they will "activate" your pass.

Within a few seconds, the name of the "OK" button on the pass should change to "Configure Connection". When this happens, press the button and you will be automatically connected to the Wi-Fi Network!

## VALIDATOR

When you select this role, a login interface will be shown. We recommend pressing the QR scanner button in the top right corner and scanning the QR code that appears in the MyWifiPass administration panel to login as an administrator.

Once that is done, you will be able to:
- Validate Wi-Fi Passes from users accessing the location. This will retrieve their ID document and name, which you should compare to those of the person.
- Activate Wi-Fi Passes once you confirm the identity. This will allow them to join the Wi-Fi network, so make sure to double-check the identity!
